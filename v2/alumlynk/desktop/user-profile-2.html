              Some of MPG’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to
              facilitate travelers’ ability to (1) enter into vacation rental
              agreements with property owners and managers (“Vacation Rentals”),
              (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3)

              (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such
              Experiences (each such supplier of a vacation rental and/or
              Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate
              affiliates of MPG syndicate their advertisements to other entities

              subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in

              You agree that all claims you may have against MPG arising from or

              as a consumer - and this cannot be excluded by contract and will
              not be governed by the United Nations Conventions on Contracts for

              the Courts of your country of residence. This clause shall

              content, to analyze your use of our Services, to improve our
              Services and to provide contextual advertising or recommendations.
              For example, we may use your location to show you reviews of

              traveling.

              between your system and ours, and between our system and those of
              the parties with whom we share information. We also employ

            <h4>Do Not Track Signals</h4>

              Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track”
              (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of
              global standardized interpretation that defines “Do Not Track”
              signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to
              this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach.

              successful local business directory that is free list and to use
              we must maintain a safe, secure and reputable site. We don't need
              to list every business in a community, we only want to list those
              with the great customer service and we will delist any business
              that doesn't maintain above average customer service. This is why
              you will not find businesses on our site with a 1 or 2 rating with
              consistent negative reviews for very long. We understand that it
              is not easy to run a business and our site is not here to
              negativelly effect their business efforts so this is why we delist
              these sites as appossed to keeping them listed. Our Users would
              rather find the best businesses to work with in the 1st place.
